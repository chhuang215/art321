													<li>At the start, the alarm is flashing and I am naked. I assume I can interact with alarm clock and closet.</li>
													<li>Turn off the clock, it stops flashing. Interacted with closet, successfully put on clothes and carries the briefcase.</li>
													<li>At the kitchen, TV flashing and wife cooking. At this point I assume I am able to interact with moving elements in the game.</li>
													<li>Turn off the TV (Can turn back on as well), and talk to wife.</li>
													<li>Tries to interact with fridge, nothing happend</li>
													<li>At hallway, press elevator button.</li>
													<li>Elevator door opens, I can stand there and do nothing and the door will close. So I press the button again.</li>
													<li>In elevator and talked to old lady.</li>
													<li>At outside, I decide to head right towards parking lot sign which is flashing blue.</li>
													<li>Next scene I am driving in a car. I get off the car and starts walking.</li>
													<li>See a cow, pet the cow. The effect is a short zoom in showing me petting on the cow's head.</li>
													<li>The cow is still there, can't interact anymore, proceed to walk.</li>
													<li>Kept driving, came to a stop. Wait a while and the leaf fell off the tree and I catched it. (Because I was typing this, or else I never knew the leaf would fall.)</li>
													<li>Being yelled at boss saying I'm late. Sees the graph dropping.</li>
													<li>Talked to the boss, and he tells me to go to my cubicle. I kept walking towards right.</li>
													<li>Sees 5 employees that look like me. Kept walking towards right.</li>
													<li>Sees 7 employees that look like me. Kept walking towards right.</li>
													<li>Sees 9 employees that look like me and an empty seat that is probably for me. Ignore the interaction and kept walking towards right to the exit sign.</li>
													<li>At this point the camera is very zoomed out. I am at the edge of building, I can.. jump?</li>
													<li>Decide to suicide. Back to beginning</li>

													<li>I ignore the alarm and this time I decide to go outside naked.</li>
													<li>Wife says to dress up. This dialog is different than last run. Kept walking towards hallway.</li>
													<li>Same interaction with elevator because it seems like there is no other possibility.</li>
													<li>Old lady said "2 more steps and you will be new person" as oppose to "5 more steps". I assume I am closer to achive something? Or maybe it is random.</li>
													<li>At outside, I decide to head left this time.</li>
													<li>Sees a homeless and a red light. And the homeless seems interactable. This might be the firt interactable element that is not moving initially.</li>
													<li>Before interacting with homeless, I wait if the red light will ever turn green just like waiting the leaf to fall down the tree.</li>
													<li>Seems like the red light will never turn green. Proceed to talk to homeless man.</li>
													<li>Visited the graveyard and back to beginning.</li>

													<li>Decide to go outside naked again.</li>
													<li>Every process is the same except this time the old lady says "one more steps and you will be new person". I think my assumption is correct. I need one more element to finish this game.</li>
													<li>I head left, the homeless is not there. Nothing to interact.</li>
													<li>Walk towards parking lot.</li>
													<li>In the driving scene, I get off car and see if there is any difference in the cow scene. The cow is not there. Decides to keep driving to work.</li>
													<li>I noticed the leaf on the tree is gone.</li>
													<li>Sees boss and being asked where is my tie. Also notice that the graph drops lower. The next moment I got fired with a head shot of boss's head yelling.</li>
